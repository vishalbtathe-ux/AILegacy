Legacy System Architecture Overview

Our current legacy system is built on the following technologies:
- Database: Oracle 11g running on-premises
- Application Server: Apache Tomcat 7
- Frontend: JSP pages with jQuery
- Backend: Java EE with EJB 2.1
- Authentication: LDAP integration

Security Considerations:
- All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256
- SSL/TLS 1.2 for data in transit
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
- Regular security audits conducted quarterly

Modernization Goals:
- Migrate to cloud infrastructure (AWS or Azure)
- Containerize applications using Docker
- Implement microservices architecture
- Upgrade to modern Java frameworks (Spring Boot)
- Replace JSP with React or Angular frontend
- Move from Oracle to PostgreSQL or cloud-native database

Current Challenges:
- Monolithic architecture makes scaling difficult
- Legacy code has limited documentation
- High maintenance costs
- Difficulty recruiting developers familiar with old tech stack
